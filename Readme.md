# South High Demo 

## http://is.gd/southhigh

## Description
This site was made as a simple demo showing what could be done with a small amount of code.

## How it works
The [landing page](http://is.gd/southhigh) simply records the user agent of the client. 
The [graph view](http://curtisallen.github.io/southhigh/#/graph) visulizes this data. Each small circle repesents a hit, these hits are linked to the larger circles that repersent the type of device used to view the landing page.
